# Java-to-Web code Conversion (Template)

Use this checklist each time you want to convert a Java method/workflow into the web app.

## 1) Old Java method (source of truth)
- Paste the full Java method (or the relevant portion).
- Include any related helper methods if they affect flow/conditions.

## 2) Target web UI (HTML snippet)
- Paste the relevant part of the HTML page (fields/buttons involved).
- Include element IDs and any groups that are shown/hidden.

## 3) Mapping list (Java control → DOM element / action)
Examples:
- `vAmountField` → `#vAmountField`
- `addingField` → `#addingField`
- `cBoxReason` → `#reasonForVoucher`
- `printButton.fire()` → `document.getElementById("printButton").click()`

## 4) Rules / edge cases (behavior requirements)
Examples:
- “length > 9 means scanned code”
- “reason must pop up immediately when combining”
- “if user types any letters, stop process, alert, clear field, refocus”
- “Enter must not submit the form”

## 5) External dependencies (needed to implement logic)
Provide code or interfaces for:
- fetch functions (inputs/outputs)
- servlet endpoints
- XML/JSON inputs and formats
- localStorage keys used

## 6) Definition of done (test sequences)
Write 2–6 short “user does X → expects Y” flows, e.g.:
- Scan voucher A → multiple vouchers group shows → addingField updates → cursor returns to voucher field
- Scan voucher B → reason prompt appears immediately → Enter on reason triggers print
- Type `1d1d53` → invalid alert → field cleared → focus returns to voucher field
